/* We're building a football betting app (soccer for my American friends �)!
Suppose we get data from a web service about a certain game ('game' variable on
next page). In this challenge we're gonna work with that data.
Your tasks:
1. Create one player array for each team (variables 'players1' and
'players2')
2. The first player in any player array is the goalkeeper and the others are field
players. For Bayern Munich (team 1) create one variable ('gk') with the
goalkeeper's name, and one array ('fieldPlayers') with all the remaining 10
field players
3. Create an array 'allPlayers' containing all players of both teams (22
players)
4. During the game, Bayern Munich (team 1) used 3 substitute players. So create a
new array ('players1Final') containing all the original team1 players plus
'Thiago', 'Coutinho' and 'Perisic'
5. Based on the game.odds object, create one variable for each odd (called
'team1', 'draw' and 'team2')
6. Write a function ('printGoals') that receives an arbitrary number of player
names (not an array) and prints each of them to the console, along with the
number of goals that were scored in total (number of player names passed in)
7. The team with the lower odd is more likely to win. Print to the console which
team is more likely to win, without using an if/else statement or the ternary
operator.
Test data for 6.: First, use players 'Davies', 'Muller', 'Lewandowski' and 'Kimmich'.
Then, call the function again with players from game.scored
GOOD LUCK */

/* Challenge 2
1. Loop over the game.scored array and print each player name to the console, 
along with the goal number (Example: "Goal 1: Lewandowski")
2. Use a loop to calculate the average odd and log it to the console (We already 
studied how to calculate averages, you can go check if you don't remember)
3. Print the 3 odds to the console, but in a nice formatted way, exactly like this:
Odd of victory Bayern Munich: 1.33
Odd of draw: 3.25
Odd of victory Borrussia Dortmund: 6.5
Get the team names directly from the game object, don't hardcode them 
(except for "draw"). Hint: Note how the odds and the game objects have the 
same property names �
4. Bonus: Create an object called 'scorers' which contains the names of the 
players who scored as properties, and the number of goals as the value. In this 
game, it will look like this:
{
 Gnarby: 1,
 Hummels: 1,
 Lewandowski: 2
}

average, every 9 minutes" (keep in mind that a game has 90 minutes)

whether it's in the first half or second half (after 45 min) of the game, like this:

/*Write a program that receives a list of variable names written in underscore_case 
and convert them to camelCase.
The input will come from a textarea inserted into the DOM (see code below to 
insert the elements), and conversion will happen when the button is pressed.
Test data (pasted to textarea, including spaces):
underscore_case
first_name
Some_Variable 
 calculate_AGE
delayed_departure
Should produce this output (5 separate console.log outputs):
underscoreCase ✅
firstName ✅✅
someVariable ✅✅✅
calculateAge ✅✅✅✅
delayedDeparture ✅✅✅✅✅
Hints:
§ Remember which character defines a new line in the textarea �
§ The solution only needs to work for a variable made out of 2 words, like a_b
§ Start without worrying about the ✅. Tackle that only after you have the variable 
name conversion working �
§ This challenge is difficult on purpose, so start watching the solution in case 
you're stuck. Then pause and continue!
Afterwards, test with your own test data!

/* Let's build a simple poll app!
A poll has a question, an array of options from which people can choose, and an 
array with the number of replies for each option. This data is stored in the starter 
'poll' object below.
Your tasks:
1. Create a method called 'registerNewAnswer' on the 'poll' object. The 
method does 2 things:
1.1. Display a prompt window for the user to input the number of the 
selected option. The prompt should look like this:
What is your favourite programming language?
0: JavaScript
1: Python
2: Rust
3: C++
(Write option number)
1.2. Based on the input number, update the 'answers' array property. For 
example, if the option is 3, increase the value at position 3 of the array by 
1. Make sure to check if the input is a number and if the number makes 
sense (e.g. answer 52 wouldn't make sense, right?)
2. Call this method whenever the user clicks the "Answer poll" button.
3. Create a method 'displayResults' which displays the poll results. The 
method takes a string as an input (called 'type'), which can be either 'string'
or 'array'. If type is 'array', simply display the results array as it is, using 
console.log(). This should be the default option. If type is 'string', display a 
string like "Poll results are 13, 2, 4, 1".
4. Run the 'displayResults' method at the end of each 
'registerNewAnswer' method call.
5. Bonus: Use the 'displayResults' method to display the 2 arrays in the test 
data. Use both the 'array' and the 'string' option. Do not put the arrays in the poll 
object! So what should the this keyword look like in this situation? */

    answers: new Array(4).fill(0),

    registerNewAnswer(){
        const answer = Number(
            prompt(`${this.question}\n${this.options.join('\n')}\n(Write   option number)`
            )
        );

        this.displayResults();
        this.displayResults('string');

    // Register Answer

        if(type === 'array'){
